# airport-js

This is a test-driven implementation of the [Airport challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge) stories
in JavaScript. Jasmine was used for testing and ESLint for linting.

## Stories

```
As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport
```
